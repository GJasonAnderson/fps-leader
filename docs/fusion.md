# Fusion Weekend  2019 | January 18-20
*Fusion is an overnight weekend retreat that begins on Friday evening and ends on Sunday afternoon. Leaders and students will stay in a local host home for fellowship, small group time, some meals, and trying to get some sleep every night. Live worship services are held Friday night and throughout the day Saturday. The weekend closes out on Sunday at your local campus.*

Fusion 2019 is earlier in the year that in the past, so it's super important that leaders secure host homes as early as possible. Start asking parents of your students NOW - **our goal this year is for every small group to have a host home by Thanksgiving!**
