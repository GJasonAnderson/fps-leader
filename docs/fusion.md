# Fusion Weekend | February 23-25
<button id="MyButton" onclick="myFunction()">What is Fusion?</button>
<div id="MyToggleDiv" style="display: none;">
Fusion is an overnight weekend retreat that begins on Friday evening and ends on Sunday afternoon. Leaders and students will stay in a local host home for fellowship, small group time, some meals, and trying to get some sleep every night. Live worship services are held each night at the Pellissippi campus. Schedules and more details will be communicated as the event approaches.

## Tasks To Do Now
**Fusion begins <span id="MyTimer"></span>**    
We still have several small group leaders who are not signed up for Fusion. We canâ€™t place students in their groups unless we know that their group is going to exist at Fusion. Our top priority is getting all leaders registered and submitting your host home information ASAP (links to both online forms can be found below). **The deadline for student registrations is February 14th at midnight!**

## Fusion Leader Guide
This year's [ Leader Guide ]( Fusion Leader Guide 2018.pdf ) is available now - hard copies will also be available on Wednesday.

## Registration Links
