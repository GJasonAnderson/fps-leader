# Fusion Weekend  
*Fusion is an overnight weekend retreat that begins on Friday evening and ends on Sunday afternoon. Leaders and students will stay in a local host home for fellowship, small group time, some meals, and trying to get some sleep every night. Live worship services are held Friday night and throughout the day Saturday at the Pellissippi campus. The weekend closes out on Sunday at your local campus.*

Dates and more details about Fusion 2019 will be posted here as soon as they are available.
