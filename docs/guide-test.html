  <h1>Uncommon</h1>

  <h2><b>Week 2:</b> Uncommon Work</h2>

  <p><b>Whatwe want students to learn:</b> God is constantly at work and we just have to open our eyes and our hearts to see how He is working.</p>

  <p><b>What we want students to do with what they have learned:</b> Be able to recognize and appreciate all that God is doing.</p>

  <p><b>Large Group Message Focus:</b> Exodus 16 and Numbers 11</p>

  <p><b>Scripture Focus:</b> Hebrews 2:1-3</p>

  <p><b>Supporting Scripture:</b> Philippians 1:6</p>

  <h3>The Main Point</h3>

  <p>In life we are sometimes prone to looking past the work that God is doing. We either give ourselves credit for the things that are at work in our lives, or we completely disregard the everyday works that are happening in our life. We should be able to notice God’s work.</p>

  <h4>Ice-Breaker</h4>

  <b>What is your favorite part of school?</b>

  <p>School, for most people, is not very fun. You may not even have a favorite part. But, it is such a privilege that you are able to get an education and learn about all the subjects in school. God has put school in your life for a purpose, and it is very often that teens take that for granted. Only 58% of kids in the world are getting an elementary education.</p>

  <p>PRAY that your few would be reminded of the work that God is doing in their lives, constantly.</p>

  <h4>Lesson</h4>

  <p>Read Hebrews 2:1-3. Then ask another student to reread verse 1-3, and consider using another translation. Ask several students their perspective of these 3 verses.</p>

  <p><font color="red">Hebrews 2:1-3 (NIV)</font> - We must pay the most careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. 2 For since the message spoken through angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment, 3 how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him.</p>

  <p><b>In your own words, what is the author trying to say in these verses?</b></p>

  <p><i>(v.1 )There are no wrong answers here, but it can be important to note that some versions read “let them slip”, which conveys a vivid picture of a man holding a treasure and then allows it to drop. This verse helps us to become more aware of the works He is doing. (v.2) Again, no wrong answers. But it is important to mention that this message of Jesus was true and when we really stand back and think about it, it is quite amazing. (v.3) This verse is basically asking “how can we, as sinners, escape the penalty of sin, if we do not follow Jesus?”</i></p>

  <p><b>In what ways could you be taking for granted your salvation with God and other ways He has blessed you?</b></p>

  <p>Read Philippians 1:6.</p>

  <p><font color="red">Philippians 1:6</font> - being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.</p>

  <p><b>What does this verse promise followers of Jesus?</b></p>

  <p><i>That God is continually doing things in our lives to bring our lives into completion. Genuine spiritual progress is rooted in what God has done, is doing, and will do.</i></p>

  <p><b>What reason does Paul give for why he believes the Philippians will finish the race to the end?</b></p>

  <p><i>Because of God’s promise to be with them until the end. His faithfulness ensures that He will be with believers until Jesus returns. God will not abandon you. No matter what.</i></p>

  <p><b>How will this knowledge allow you to finish His work and acknowledge His work in the next week?</b></p>

  <p><i>For us to be uncommon, we have to be set apart. That means we have to do the things other people are not doing. Many people cannot see God moving in the simple, everyday moments in their lives because they are not looking for Him. If we are able to see God in everyday moments, it will be easier for us to trust in Him every day.</i></p>

  <h4>Life Application</h4>

  <p><b>What are some blessings from God that you may be taking for granted in your everyday life?</b></p>

  <p><i>His constant love, your spiritual gifts from Him, life, your ability to work and go to school, etc.</i></p>

  <p><b>Have your students decide on a Bible story together that they are familiar with and have them summarize it aloud. Then, allow the students time to think about this literally, using the prompts below as an example.</b></p>

  <p><i>Ex. Jesus LITERALLY died on a cross, Moses LITERALLY parted the Red Sea, etc.</i></p>

  <p><i>This allows you to keep it in perspective that God was at work in their lives and really did all these super cool things we read in the Bible. It can be easy to lose sight of that.</i></p>

  <h4>Take It Out</h4>

  <p>Close small group out with prayer requests. Pray that your students would open their eyes to all that God is doing in their lives and through His works.</p>

  <p>After prayer, be sure to remind them of any upcoming group serving activities or student events and THE WEEKEND!</p>
