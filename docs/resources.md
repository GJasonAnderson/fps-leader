# Resources  
Here are some resources that can hopefully make you a better FPS leader than you already are!  

## Student Rosters  
FPS now has a way for you to view information for the students in your group! Here's the official announcement, in case you missed it.  
> Many of you have been asking how group leaders can access their groups in Ministry Platform. I have attached a step by step document that will teach them how to access that information. The groups only contain students that have attended since the school year started. **IMPORTANT:** Please do not remove students from groups UNLESS, 1) they have not attended in fpStudents in the last 18 months, or 2) they have moved/you are certain they are not coming back to fpStudents for some reason. If they do fit the previous criteria, please go ahead and remove them to clean up the roster! This is to ensure that if a student decides to take a 6 month hiatus, they are welcomed back in their assigned group when they decide to return home. ðŸ˜Š  If there is a question or incorrect information (which is likely) please email me and I will make the necessary adjustments!

### Parents  
Similar to the above, but from the perspective of a parent. Feel free to share these as needed.
