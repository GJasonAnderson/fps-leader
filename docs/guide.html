  <h2>Scripture</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>John 11:21-27 - "Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you had been here, my brother would not have died. But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask." Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again." Martha answered, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day." Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?" "Yes, Lord," she replied, "I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world."</li>
      <li>What is Jesus saying in these scriptures?</li>
    </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>If comfortable, what are some things in your life that make you feel broken or lost?</li>
    <li>Why do you think that we as humans believe we're too "broken" to be loved by God?</li>
    <li>Has there ever been a time in your life where you felt that Jesus "resurrected" something for you like He did with Lazarus and his family? It doesn't have to be someone being raised from the dead but maybe Jesus brought you hope, love, or helped you through hard times.</li>
  </ul>

      <li>Ask students who they will tell about how Jesus change their lives by "resurrecting" them?</li>
    </ul>
