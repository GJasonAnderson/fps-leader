  <h2>Week 3: What is Sex?</h2>

  <p><b>What we want students to learn:</b> God's design for sex is better than the worlds design for sex. Embrace and trust God's plan for sex because he created sex and knows that it is good within His design.</p>
  <p><b>What we want students to do with what they've learned:</b> Understand that sex is a gift from God and that we need to follow His command of staying pure until marriage.</p>
  <p><b>Scripture Focus:</b> 1 Corinthians 6:16-17</p>
  <p><b>Supporting Scripture:</b> Galatians 6:7, Matthew 22:37, Judges 16:22</p>

  <h2>The Main Point</h2>
  <p>Throughout this group guide we will debunk three myths about sex and God's plan for us. The myths are:
    <ol>
      <li>Sex is only physical.</li>
      <li>I can do what I want and what God wants.</li>
      <li>I've already messed up, so there's not hope for me.</li>
    </ol>
    These myths are believed by many in today's age and we hope to set the students free from these.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The point of this ice breaker is to change a perspective we have on God. When we think of God giving us rules or restraints to follow, we see it as Him being mean and doesn't want us to have fun, but we don't do that for stores or games. When we go to Home Depot and buy a chainsaw, we don't think they are inhibiting our fun when they say do not do certain things because they don't want us to cut off our arm. So ask this question about a video game, phone, board game, etc. something that has rules to optimize the benefits and not making you have less fun.</p>
    <p>THEN, ask the Ice Breaker Question:</p>
    <p class="question">Have you ever bought anything, read the manual, and said "Wow they don't want me to have any fun"?</p>
    <p>When we read restraints that God has given us about sex we see it as an insult to ourselves. We assume that He doesn't have any fun and doesn't want us to have an awesome experience. This is exactly why He gives us the rules. He gives us restraints because He wants us to have fun and not get hurt. If something is God-given, it should be God-governed.</p>
    <p>PRAY that the students understand this and see that God wants the best for them and their lives.</p>

    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>Let's tackle Myth 1: <i><b>Sex is only physical.</b></i> by reading 1 Corinthians 6:16-17 and asking your students explain what these verses means to them. (You may find using <i>The Message</i> translation to be helpful for this passage, expecially for younger students.) Help flesh this out by asking the following:</p>
    <p class="question">What level of your soul does sex involve? (Leaders: read Matthew 22:37 before you ask & answer this question)</p>
    <p class="answer">Sex involves the deepest level of yourself. It involves your mind, your soul, and your heart. Didn't Jesus say to use things to love and worship God in Matthew 22:37. If sex involves your mind, soul, and heart then it should be guarded and protected against at all costs until you are married.</p>
    <p>Facts to share with your group: Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that people with porn addiction/higher number of sexual partners have higher rates of depression and lower rates of physical health. The NYPost shared an article that 80% of males and 60% of females between the age of 18-24 are on Tinder in New York and the amount of sexual dysfunction and addiction is skyrocketing.</p>
    <p class="question">In verse 17, what does Paul say will happen if we have sex with no commitment or intimacy?</p>
    <p class="answer">It will leave us lonelier than ever.</p>
    <p>Read Galatians 6:7 and ask the following questions. We are hitting on Myth 2: <i><b>I can do whatever I want and what God wants</b></i>.</p>
    <p class="question">How many of you have said "If I just need to get it out of my system" in regards to sexual activity? (Could be done through pornography, sex with a boyfriend/girlfriend, etc.)</p>
    <p class="answer">When you do it you're not getting it out of your system you're putting it in your system. If we are sick do we put that disease, infection, etc. in our system to get it out? No, of course not. So it is the same with sex and pornography.</p>
    <p class="question">How many of you have done something wrong because you know you can ask for forgiveness later?</p>
    <p class="answer">Of course, God will forgive you. If you want something that will blow your mind, if you're a Christian then God has already forgiven you. He has forgiven things that you haven't even done yet. There is a difference between forgiveness and consequences. God will much rather be blessing you than forgiving you. God's highest good isn't forgiving you, it is enabling you to act with His power and His authority to save kids at your school, to witness to your parents, and follow the filling that He want to give you. Your desires can keep you from your destiny.</p>
    <p>Now let's take on Myth 3: <i><b>I've already messed up so there's no hope for me.</b></i> Recap the story of Samson. He had great strength, but his desire for a girl was more than that of accomplishing what God wanted Him to do. He ended up in a torture chamber, with his eyes gouged out, and grinding grain. His hair was linked to his strength, but it had been cut off. Read Judges 16:22. As hair began to grow back, so did his strength.</p>
    <p class="question">How can this verse relate to you if you have messed up already and feel no hope?</p>
    <p class="answer">You can always get your strength back! It will take time, but you can have the power and strength to overcome your past mistakes through God and God alone. He is the only one who can give you the self-control, discipline, wisdom, etc. to do better in those situations and provide you a way out.</p>

    <h2>Life Application</h2>

    <p class="question">When and where do you normally engage in these activities? How can you change that?</p>
    <p class="answer">We want the students to identify when they engage in their sexual desires and where its at. For example, if they feel the temptation to engage in pornography when no one is home or at night then they should be proactive and find an accountability partner they can text when they feel tempted or leave their phone, laptop, etc. in another room.</p>
    <p class="question">How have you noticed your quality of life and relationship with God when you engage in these behaviors and when you have followed with what God has said?</p>
    <p>Encourage your students that these desires are not wrong. They are natural and are made by God. We just follow them in the wrong context and that is why it feels wrong when we engage them outside of what God tells us to. God wants us to have a fruitful and fun life and these restraints of staying pure until marriage is one of the biggest restraints that might not seem fun now but will save you a lifetime of regret and pain. If you are able to say no to a short-term pleasure now, you will have a life of power later.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Closing Activity</h2>

    <p>Challenge your students to find an accountability partner to help them with these temptations. It could you, a student in their small group, a parent, etc.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Take It Out</h2>

    <p>Close small group out with prayer requests. Pray specifically for the group and connect prayer back to the purpose of the group guide.</p>

    <p>After prayer, be sure to remind them of any upcoming group serving activities or student events and THE WEEKEND!</p>
