  <h1>Fusion Recap Night</h1>

  <p><b>What we want students to learn:</b> The Holy Spirit desires to lead us to be more like Jesus.</p>
  <p><b>What we want students to do with what they've learned:</b> Choose to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit in their lives.</p>
  <p><b>Scripture Focus:</b> Luke 4:18-19</p>


  <h2>The Main Point</h2>

  <p>Just like that, Fusion 2019 is over. What an incredible weekend we had! As a leader, what was your favorite moment? Was it seeing your students worship, watching a student respond to the message of the gospel for the first time, or spending quality time with your students in your host home? We are so grateful for the sacrifice you made this weekend to spend time investing in the next generation. Thank you!</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>As you jump into small group tonight, spend some time recapping Fusion for any student that did not attend.</p>

  <p class="question">What was the main truth/theme we talked about at Fusion? What did it mean?</p>

  <p>Now that everyone is up to speed, discuss the following as you begin to unpack this week:</p>

  <p class="question">Tell one funny story from Fusion.</p>
  <p class="question">What surprised you about Fusion weekend?</p>

  <p>PRAY your students would continue to be obedient to Jesus as we have just ended Fusion and they are getting back into a regular schedule. Pray for the conversations and relationships that have been built and those that have been restored.</p>

  <h3>Lesson</h3>

  <p class="question">What was one new thing that you learned about Jesus over this past weekend?</p>
  <p class="question">Is your relationship with Jesus any different now that you have experienced Fusion? What do you think has changed?</p>

  <p>This past weekend, we talked about the role of the Holy Spirit in our lives. The following verse was the theme verse of the weekend and is the theme verse for 2019 at Faith Promise.</p>
  <p><font color=red>Luke 4:18-19 (NIV)</font> - The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me  to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.</p>

  <p class="question">What does this passage mean to you?</p>

  <p>During Fusion we had 3 services, talking about something different in each service. Spend a few minutes discussing what your students learned in each service, not only reminding them of what they learned but also telling those who did not attend about what they learned.</p>

  <p class="question">What did we learn about during the first service at Fusion?</p>
  <p class="question">What did we learn during the second service?</p>
  <p class="question">What did we learn during the third service?</p>
  <p class="question">Which service out of the three did you need to hear the most? Why?</p>

  <h3>Life Application</h3>

  <p>Now that they are back in their normal routines, the things they experienced and committed to at Fusion may likely seem a little more daunting.</p>
  <p class="question">Is there anything you committed to at Fusion that scares you now that you are back into your normal routine of school?</p>
  <p class="question">What is one thing you can do to get one step closer to this commitment?</p>
  <p class="question">How will you specifically choose to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit this week?</p>
  <p>Right now, post Fusion, your students probably have a new momentum. Help them use this momentum to better themselves, better FP Students, and most importantly, better the Kingdom. Be sure to follow up with all the students who mentioned something above. Continue to encourage, guide and pray for them as they begin to step out in faith.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Take It Out</h3>

  <p>Close small group out with prayer requests. Pray that your students would be surrendered to the work of the Holy Spirit.</p>

  <p>After prayer, be sure to remind them of Movement Conference and THE WEEKEND!</p>
