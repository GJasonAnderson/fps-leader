  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p class="question">What is your favorite Rom-com? (or, for the boys, ask what is their favorite movie with a relationship in it?) And why?</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Lesson</h3>

  <p class="question">What comes to mind when you hear the term "godly dating"?</p>
  <p class="answer">Some answers will probably be along the lines of not fun, too many rules, dry, etc. We want the students to see that there is beauty behind restraints and that godly dating is so much better than it may seem.</p>
  <p>Read Genesis 1:26-27.</p>
  <p class="question">What relationship are these verses referring to?</p>
  <p class="answer">God and man. After this, in chapter 2, God explains how it is not good for man to be alone, so He made Eve.</p>
  <p class="question">What does this verse reveal about mankind?</p>
  <p class="answer">We were made for relationships. That is what makes Christianity unique, the God we worship wants a personal relationship with us. It is not about a bunch of rules, but about a relationship with our creator. We were also made to have relationships with each other.</p>
  <p>Read Galatians 5:22.</p>
  <p class="question">How do you think fruit of the Spirit fits into talks about dating?</p>
  <p class="answer">We talk about the fruit of the Spirit in dating because true Godly relationships happen when both people involved are filled with the fruit of the Spirit.</p>
  <p class="question">How can you make sure that you are filled with the fruit of the Spirit before / during dating?</p>
  <p class="answer">For us to be spiritually ready to date and to follow the filling while dating we have to pursue our relationship with God. As we grow closer to God, we begin to desire what we He desires and we become more obedient to His commands. So if He wants us to put our boyfriend / girlfriend above ourselves then we will do that with ease. If he wants us to have certain physical boundaries, then we will want to have those too. There will be a better connection between you and your boyfriend / girlfriend if you are both growing closer to God.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Life Application</h3>

  <p class="question">What are questions you think are important to ask before you start dating someone?</p>
	<p class="answer">If I date this person, will we be unequally yoked? Is there a "too fast" in Christian dating? Should I date a Godly girl / guy I do not find attractive? Should a boyfriend "lead" his girlfriend? Should my church help me get married?</p>
  <p>Allow your students to hook on to one or two of these questions and really dive into the answer and have genuine conversations about what it looks like.</p>
  <p class="question">What boundaries will you set for when you do / are dating someone?</p>
  <p class="question">How will you maintain those boundaries?</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Closing Activity</h3>

  <p>Challenge your students to continuously pray for their future relationships and that they are filled with the fruit of the Spirit and are strong and healthy.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Take It Out</h3>

  <p>Close small group out with prayer requests. Pray specifically for the group and their current relationships and future relationships.</p>

  <p>After prayer, be sure to remind them of any upcoming group serving activities or student events and THE WEEKEND!</p>
