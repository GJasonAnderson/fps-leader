  <h2>Life / Intro Questions (Choose one or two)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>What's the best thing you have ever received for Easter?</li>
      <li>What was the best thing to happen to you this week? What was the lowest thing to happen to you?</li>
      <li>Did you invite anyone to FPS Easter? How was the experience? Was it difficult?</li>
    </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>

    <p>Have you ever befriended someone or done something kind for someone just because you cared, not because you'd get something in return? A few of you talk about that and what motivated you at the time.</p>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>

    <p>Jesus died for you to forgive your sins and give you FREEDOM.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>

    <p><b>John 3:16-21</b>: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God."</p>

    <p><b>What is it about mankind that God believed would be worth the cost of his Son's life in order to save?</b></p>

  <h2>Interactive Activity</h2>

    <p><b>Leader says</b>: God wants to free you from ALL your sin! He wants to forgive you and set you free because he has your best interest in mind. He LOVES you so much! He has big plans for you! His desire is to see you live in freedom.</p>

    <p><b>Leader says</b>: I want you to think about these following questions: <br>(<i>Make sure to give them time to sit in silence and think about each question</i>.)
      <ul>
        <li>What sin(s) do you need to be forgiven of?</li>
        <li>What is that one sin you're holding on to that you're not letting go of.</li>
        <li>Do you want to be free from it? Do you want to live in COMPLETE freedom of it?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p><b>Leaders says</b>: God wants to set you free of EVERY SIN! His desire is that we wouldn't let any sin keep us in bondage.</p>

    <p><b>Leaders says</b>: Are you ready to be free today? Jesus died for all of our junk! All of our sin!</p>

    <p><b>Leaders says</b>: Let Jesus set you free, put your sin on the cross! Jesus died for <b>you to be free!</b></p>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>Leaders, each group will be provided with sharpies, a duct tape role and a little wooden cross.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Give each student a sharpie and piece of duct tape to write down the sin that is holding them back.</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>They do not have to put the exact sin on the tape if they want privacy. They can put a word that represents the sin that only they know what it means. However, encourage students that this group is a safe place. We do not judge each other but we are here to help and lift each other up.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Have them stick the duct tape to the cross.</b></li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Celebrate!</h2>

  <p>Take time to celebrate that we are no longer burdened by our sins; we are set free because of what Jesus did on the cross for us! Encourage students that once you give these sins to God and ask him to set you free, it may still be hard sometimes; but with God, we can get back up when we mess up! We can be FREE!</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Leaders follow up with students during the week and encourage them to keep pressing on.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Some of them may have fallen back into past sin but remind them of what God did on Wednesday. Just because we have moments of failure, it does not mean we are failures.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Encourage students to be here next Wednesday as we continue on our new series, "Fooled." God is up to awesome things at FPS!</li>
  </ul>
