  <h2>Week 1: What About My Feelings?</h2>

  <p><b>What we want students to learn:</b> Feelings are great, but they don't drive us. The Holy Spirit does.</p>
  <p><b>What we want students to do with what they've learned:</b> Evaluate their pursuit of romantic relationships in light of what God says and not their feelings.</p>
  <p><b>Large Group Message Focus:</b> Judges 13-16</p>
  <p><b>Small Group Scripture Focus:</b> Psalm 25:1-25</p>
  <p><b>Supporting Scripture:</b> Proverbs 3:5</p>

  <h2>The Main Point</h2>

  <p>Tonight's lesson focuses on recognizing that our relationships are usually more than a relationship - they become an obsession. If we aren't in one we are consumed with finding one and if we are in one we are consumed with the other person. Our feelings are powerful motivators, but they can't be trusted. By putting our trust in God and not our feelings we can see consistency and position ourselves to be blessed in all areas of our life, including our dating life.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p class="question">Have you ever been obsessed with someone or something? Why?</p>

  <p class="answer">This can be funny or serious! A new ice cream flavor, video game, boy/girl? The goal is to acknowledge the root of the desire to pursue that "thing" is because of how it made them feel.</p>

  <p>PRAY that God will help open our eyes to things that we pursue and how to pursue them in a way that honors Him.</p>

  <h3>Lesson</h3>

  <p>We are going to explore Psalm 25 and see what God says about our feelings and how they fit in our lives.</p>
  <p class="question">Read Psalm 25:1-5. Where should we put our trust (effort, pursuit)?</p>
  <p class="answer">Our trust (our motivator) is supposed to be God.</p>
  <p class="question">What happens to those who put their trust in God? What happens to those that don't?</p>
  <p class="answer">Shame in verse three means to have a feeling of fear or shame which prevents a person from doing a thing.</p>
  <p class="answer">Those who trust God are never put to shame – they walk forward without fear, but those who don't trust God will end up afraid and regressing.</p>
  <p class="question">Do you ever feel so strongly about something but know that God says something different? Share a moment and what you trusted and how it turned out.</p>
  <p class="answer">Sometimes our feelings don't initially seem to lead us into bad things, but as time goes on when we operate outside of God's design we end up with experiences that shape us. I played that video game for 10 hours straight and it was awesome, but it was also unhealthy and you missed time in the real world. We may not be aware of how our feelings are leading us.</p>
  <p class="question">What do you trust most? Why?</p>
  <p class="answer">Trust: to believe in the reliability, truth, ability, or strength of.</p>
  <p class="answer">Work here to encourage students to evaluate what they trust as a result of fruit. I trust myself, my friends, God based on decisions they have made versus what they think they trust.</p>

  <h3>Life Application</h3>

  <p>Proverbs 3:5 calls us to trust God even when we don't understand why He allows or asks us to do something.</p>
  <p class="question">Where in your life right now can you trust God where you trust yourself?</p>
  <p class="question">Why don't you trust God there now?</p>
  <p class="answer">Often the root answer to this is we really don't believe that God is who He says He is and loves us the way He says. God made us and knows us best. When we don’t trust Him we call Him a liar.</p>
  <p class="question">What does trusting God look like in your dating life?</p>
  <p class="answer">Who you choose to date may look different (God's values of heart over your values of fun and looks).</p>
  <p class="answer">Not dating someone because you want something from them – not to feel lonely, physical expectations, etc.</p>
