  <h1>Fusion Preview Night</h1>

  <h2>The Main Point</h2>

  <p>Fusion is coming! Can you believe it is already here? Now, we have a feeling that your small group time is going to be full of lots of questions about Fusion and we want to give you as much time as possible to discuss details with your students about their host home, what to bring, what to expect, and all kinds of other questions that may arise.</p>

  <h3>Lesson</h3>

  <p class="question">What are you most excited about for this weekend?</p>
  <p class="question">Is there a specific part of your relationship with Jesus that you hope to learn more about this weekend?</p>

  <p>This weekend, we are going to be talking about who we choose to follow. As the weekend progresses, we will begin to talk about following the Holy Spirit's leading in our lives. Discuss the following questions to get your students thinking about the topics for this weekend. The purpose of this time isn't to determine the correct answers to these questions, but to get your students thinking about the content for this weekend before the weekend begins.</p>

  <p class="question">What are some common things, or people, that people are the most tempted to follow other than Jesus?</p>
  <p class="question">If you were going to describe the Holy Spirit to a friend in a sentence of two, how would you describe Him?</p>
  <p class="question">What do you think it means to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit?</p>
  <p>This week, we are going to talk about the answers to these questions and more. Prepare for an incredible weekend!</p>

  <h3>Life Application</h3>

  <p>As you close out small group tonight, encourage your students, over the next two days, to think about who or what they are tempted to follow besides Jesus.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Take It Out</h3>

  <p>Close small group out with prayer requests. Pray that the Lord would begin to soften the hearts of your students towards His Word and His leading in their lives.</p>

  <p>After prayer, be sure to invite any students who are not attending Fusion to join your group on Sunday morning for service.</p>
