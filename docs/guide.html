  <h1><i>Fooled</i> Week 3 - What lies are you believing?</h1>

  <hr>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions (Choose one or two)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The zombie apocalypse is coming, who are 3 people you want on your team and why?</li>
      <li>What takes up most of your free time (School, Fortnite, boy/girl etc.)?</li>
      <li>Share a memory or past story of Movement - <b>Leaders please talk about Movement!</b></li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>What currently is your main focus in life? What are you spending the most energy on?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>

    <p>When we focus on God, we find what we are looking for and so much more. </p>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>

    <p><b>Matthew 6:33</b>: But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Why is it often hard for us to seek God's plan and his will for our life before we move to action?</b></li>
    </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Explain a time when you followed your heart and it ended badly.</li>
    <li>Why do you think the world wants us to focus on ourselves instead of other people?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>

    <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>How can we focus on God in a world that wants us to focus on ourselves?</li>
      <li>What is one action step we can take to help us focus on God's will instead of our own desires?</li>
    </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Make an intention to say something encouraging to each student in your group before the night is over.</li>
    <li>Remember to try and attend a student's sporting or extraarticular event and even bring a few other group members or leaders. When leaders show up to students' activities, it means the world to them. Let's do life together!</li>
  </ul>
