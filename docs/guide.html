  <h1>Follow the Filling</h1>

  <h2>January Week 2</h2>

  <p><b>What we want students to learn:</b> We can walk in victory.</p>

  <p><b>What we want students to do with what they have learned:</b> Commit to the FP devotional during the month of January.</p>

  <p><b>Scripture Focus:</b> Romans 7:18-19, 21, 24</p>

  <h3>The Main Point</h3>

  <p>Each year, Pastor Chris and the staff team at Faith Promise write a devotional book for the congregation. The theme this year is about the work of the Holy Spirit and the book is called <i>Follow the Filling: Where the Spirit Leads, I will Follow</i>. This year, we want to challenge you and your students to commit to doing this devotional as well.</p>

  <p>As you prepare for small group tonight, text your students and encourage them to bring their copy of <i>Follow the Filling</i> if they have one.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>Before you jump into the devotional for the day, take time to recap your students' weeks.</p>

  <p class="question">What was the best part of your week and the worst part of your week? (Many call this activity "highs and lows")</p>

  <p>PRAY as you begin your group tonight that students would develop a desire to study God's Word.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Lesson</h3>

  <p>Today, you and your students are going to walk through day 9 of the devotional together, the same day that the church is also covering. Day 9 is titled "Walking in Victory."</p>

  <p>So, here's what you need to do:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Bring your copy of the devotional. Or, pick up a book from your student pastor if you have not received one yet.
    <li>Encourage your students to bring theirs as well if they have one.
    <li>Read the devotional together.
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>Consider stopping after every few paragraphs, or after each natural breaking point in the text. Have your group summarize what they read, and allow them to ask questions.
      </ol>
    <li>Read and discuss the corresponding questions together.
  </ol>

  <p>The reason you had your group time in this format tonight is to empower students to commit to this study on their own. Our hope is that tonight took the "intimidation factor" out of this challenge.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Take It Out</h3>

  <p>Close small group out with prayer requests. Pray specifically that your group would commit to reading God's Word together, and that the Lord would speak to them through it. Also, thank God for His Word that He gave to us.</p>

  <p>After prayer, be sure to remind them of any upcoming group serving activities or student events and THE WEEKEND!</p>
