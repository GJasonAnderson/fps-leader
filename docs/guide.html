  <h2>Life Application</h2>

    <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What is one area of your life where you can rely on God's strength for instead of your own strength?</li>
      <li>How can we rely on God to fight our battles so that we don't have to?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Have students partner up with a buddy and pray over each other for strength to overcome the specific situations in their lives where they want to fight battles that God needs to fight for them.</li>
    <li>Remember to contact your students this week and remind them that they are not fighting battles alone. You can draw strength from this group!</li>
    <li>Encourage your students to attend MOVEMENT! There is still time to register!!</li>
