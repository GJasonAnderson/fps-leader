  <h2>The Main Point</h2>

    <p>This week we are talking about prayer and Bible study. These can often go over looked and not really explained further than that we are supposed to do them. We will explain how prayer is easier then we think and how it helps us more than we think. Also, we will talk about studying the Bible and having you share tips with your group with how you study the Bible.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Ask this Ice Breaker Question:</p>
    <p class="question">Has there ever been a class where the teacher taught you something but didn't explain how or why it matters? Or a subject that you just never really understood?</p>
    <p>Among young believers there seems to be a misunderstanding of prayer and reading the Bible. They are used to having people do it for them, so to speak. Pastors read the Bible and teach it to them, their parents / small group leaders / pastors pray for them during service, group, etc. Also, there are times when young believers don't think that they can talk to God because they won't say the right things or just don't know how. That is what we want to change tonight.</p>
    <p>PRAY that your students will understand what prayer and studying the Bible looks like. This week is all about practice and if they are able to understand these two things then their relationship with God will grow like never before.</p>

  <h2>Lesson</h2>

    <p>Read Philippians 4:6 and ask the following questions.</p>
    <p class="question">What are your initial thoughts on prayer?</p>
    <p class="question">What does Paul tell us to not do? Do you think you can do it?</p>
    <p class="answer">He tells us to not fret or worry. It is a daunting task that Paul is asking us to do. Be anxious in nothing, BUT in everything and with thanksgiving let your requests be known to God. The Bible never commands us without empowering us.</p>
    <p class="question">What is your prayer life like? Do you feel comfortable talking to God?</p>
    <p>Read Philippians 4:7 and 1 Peter 5:7 and ask the following questions.</p>
    <p class="question">What feelings and emotions do you get when you pray?</p>
    <p class="answer">Paul lets us know that when we pray the peace of God will come upon us. God isn't surprised with what we say and then He gives us peace. We get peace because we know the fact that we made our problems known to God. Prayer changes us. We are able to tell our concerns, fear, and anxiety “get out of the way” because we have a peace greater than them. God wants to hear and listen to you.</p>
    <p class="question">How many types of prayer does Paul give to us?</p>
    <p class="answer">Paul mention three types. Prayer is the first one which just means talking. You can talk like you do with your friends. It is very relaxed, and it is when you just talk and just have a conversation with God. The second is supplication which is, if you grew up in church, what people are most familiar with. It is intensive, specific prayer. It is the type of prayer a mom would pray to save her child. It is the stereotypical prayer of a gospel preacher that most people think of. This type isn't always needed in everyday life, but it definitely is needed in certain moments. The last is thanksgiving which is literally just say thanks to God. The feeling of gratitude that you get from this kind is indescribable because all you are doing is saying thank you for what God has given you. It truly is amazing.</p>
    <p>We are now going to talk about studying the Bible. Read 2 Timothy 3:16-17 and Psalm 119:105 and ask the following questions.</p>
    <p class="question">How often do you read the Bible?</p>
    <p class="question">What is hard for you about reading the Bible?</p>
    <p class="answer">This is a great chance to give tips and advice for how you personally study the Bible and what you do for your quiet time.</p>
    <p class="question">In these two verses, what does Paul and the Psalmist say the Bible is used for?</p>
    <p class="answer">It is used for teaching, reproof, training in righteousness, equipment for good works, and being a light to our path. The Bible helps us train in righteousness and to become more like Jesus. It helps us know what to do in tough situations and show us the way when it seems difficult to know what is right.</p>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>

    <p class="question">What are your thoughts on prayer and Bible study now?</p>
    <p class="answer">Hopefully, they feel more confident in their knowledge of what prayer and Bible studying is and how to implement it in their lives.</p>
    <p class="question">How could you fit in Bible studying and prayer times this week?</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Closing Activity</h2>

  <p>Have your students figure out a time and a plan for studying the Bible this week and praying in a way that is comfortable with them.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>

  <p>Close small group out with prayer requests. Pray specifically for the group and connect prayer back to the purpose of the group guide.</p>

  <p>After prayer, be sure to remind them of any upcoming group serving activities or student events and THE WEEKEND!</p>
