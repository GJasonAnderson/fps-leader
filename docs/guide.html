  <h2>Week 5: Filling Leads to Fruit</h2>

  <p><b>What we want students to learn:</b> Fruit exposes our foundation - what does your fruit say about what you're building your life on?</p>
  <p><b>What we want students to do with what they've learned:</b> To learn how to let go of finding our identity in our problems, beliving in the fact that God works in grace and mercy and not our success, and that God will find and come to us.</p>
  <p><b>Large Group Message Focus:</b> Galatians 5:22-23. Large group was about how when our fruit exposes our foundation and how to have good fruit, we need to let Christ have our lives.
  <p><b>Scripture Focus:</b> John 5:1-15</p>
  <p><b>Supporting Scripture:</b> Matthew 10:39</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p class="question">Have you ever asked someone a question that you knew the truth to, but you wanted the right answer not the truthful answer? Explain the situation.</p>

  <p>The point of the question is to relate this to our relationship with God. Many times, we ask God for what we should do fully knowing what we should do and looking for Him to say something else. We "surrender" our lives and ask God to take what we offer, but we only offer part of our lives and not the whole thing. We need to let go. What does that mean?</p>

  <p>PRAY that the students will hear what God has for their lives, are ready to root the foundation of their life in Christ, and so that they will follow the filling of the Holy Spirit and produce some amazing fruit.</p>

  <h3>Lesson</h3>

  <p>Read Matthew 10:39 and ask the following questions.</p>
  <p class="question">What does this verse explain we should do?</p>
  <p class="answer">This verse is telling us to let go of our lives. When we let go, we not only find who we are, but more importantly we find out who God really is.</p>
  <p class="question">Before we dig into this topic, what do you think letting go means?</p>
  <p>Read John 5:1-15 all the way through and then reread John 5:1-6.</p>
  <p class="question">What does Jesus ask the paralyzed man?</p>
  <p class="answer">Jesus asks the question, "Do you want to be healed?". Now Jesus doesn't ask this question to be sarcastic or to make the man feel bad for being paralyzed. Jesus asks this question because He wants to know if the man wants to let go of the emotional connection he has made to his pain.</p>
  <p class="question">What is the thing in your life that is paralyzing you and you have started to identify with it?</p>
  <p class="answer">It could be what someone has said about you, an addiction you have, what your family life is like, how much money you have, whatever it is God did not intend for us to live like this. There is no rule that we have to hang on to what he/she said to us. There is no rule that we have to be defined by what we have done.</p>
  <p>Read John 5:7 and ask the following questions.</p>
  <p class="question">What was the paralyzed man's answer to Jesus asking him if he wants to be healed?</p>
  <p class="answer">The man complained that he didn't have any friends to take him to the pool and when the pool stirred up, he wasn't fast enough to get there first.</p>
  <p class="question">Do you believe that success is given to the fastest, smartest, and strongest?</p>
  <p class="answer">We keep telling ourselves that we wouldn't be the way that we are if we were just stronger, more self-sufficient, smarter with our choices, etc. The paralyzed man lived in Bethesda which meant "House of Mercy". Now mercy does not care about the fastest and strongest because mercy is getting what you don't deserve. Our God works in terms of grace and mercy.</p>
  <p>Read John 5:14 and ask the following questions.</p>
  <p class="question">What did Jesus do in this verse and where was the man?</p>
  <p class="answer">Jesus FOUND the man and the man was in the temple.</p>
  <p class="question">Why do you think that the bible states that Jesus found this man in the temple?</p>
  <p class="answer">It illustrates that we cannot find God. He finds us. We have to let go of this theology of having to find God and work for His love. No. All we can do is go to the temple. He will find us. We have to recognize that God has drawn near to us by coming to earth in skin and bone and dying for us so that we may draw near to Him and have a relationship with him. We have to let go of our "duty" of trying to find Him.</p>

  <h3>Life Application</h3>

  <p>The whole point of letting go and allowing God to take the foundation of our lives is that we may be filled with the Holy Spirit. For this to happen we have to take the action step of allowing God to work in us. He won't do it without our invitation.</p>
  <p class="question">In what ways, can you let go of trying to find your identity in your problems?</p>
  <p class="question">How can you start to believe that God will heal you through mercy and grace and not on your performance?</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Closing Activity</h3>

  <p>Challenge your students to start everyday pray that they can let go of the things holding them back and ask God to draw near to them and comfort them. For leaders, your challenge is to follow up during the day or at the end of the week and see how your students are doing with this.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Take It Out</h3>

  <p>Close small group out with prayer requests. Pray specifically for the group and that they will not find identity in their problems, see that God works in grace and mercy, and that God will draw near to them when they ask.</p>

  <p>After prayer, be sure to remind them of any upcoming group serving activities or student events and THE WEEKEND!</p>
