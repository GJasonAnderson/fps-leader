Small group leaders are the heartbeat of fpStudents - this ministry is thriving because of your service and sacrifice. Thank you! The Leaders' Lounge is all about making you a better small group leader - thanks in advance for spending time on this!

# Five Behaviors of a Leader  
Here's a list of the 5 behaviors that fpStudents requires from its small group leaders, the things that separate effective leaders from inadequate ones. Are you doing these things on a consistent basis?  

## Communicate Down  
Regular communication with those beneath your umbrella of care is crucial. **Small group leaders should be checking in with each of their students on a weekly basis, outside of seeing them on Wednesday night.** This could be as simple as a group text, a messaging app like [GroupMe](https://groupme.com) or [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com), or even having students follow you on social media and watching for your weekly fpStudents post. No matter whether you text, call, or visit their school for lunch with a sack full of Chick-fil-A, consistent communication is the key to showing students that you care about them and building the credibility that leads to honest conversations about their faith and lives.  

## Communicate Up  
FPS is a big operation, and it takes a small army of volunteers to do what we do every week. When leaders don't show up on Wednesday, it can be difficult to find a replacement at the last minute. Look, we get it - life happens and sometimes you just can't make it all work. When circumstances conspire against you and you won't be there, **let your coach know in advance** so other arrangements can be made. Your coach is also your main point of contact for any problems or questions about FPS in general, and he or she would also love to know what's going on in your life and walk with you through it.  

## Can Do Attitude  
Teamwork is a huge part of fpStudents, and we each have our own role to play. With that said, **we need volunteers that are flexible and willing to go the extra mile,** even when a task or situation seems to fall outside of your usual responsibilities. We would rather see you take action and step outside your comfort zone than choose inaction and miss an opportunity to show someone that we care.  

## Recruit  
Simply put, the number of volunteers we have at FPS puts a natural cap on the number of students that we can effectively reach. You are a great leader, and **we need more volunteers just like you!** Each small group should have a veteran leader and an apprentice co-leader, both preparing for the day you have so many students that you have to split into two groups. Always be on the lookout for new additions to the fpStudents family!  

## Add Value  
When nothing seems to be working with your students or you just don't know what to do next, remember that adding value to the lives of our students is the best way we can **love them the way Jesus loves us.** John Maxwell, Pastor Chris's mentor and teacher, says that it's [the most important thing that we can do](http://johnmaxwellteam.com/add-value/) as leaders.
