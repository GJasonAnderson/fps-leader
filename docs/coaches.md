# Coaches  
If small group leaders are the heart of fpStudents, then coaches are the nervous system - we have to be ready to guide our leaders down not only the communal road of making FPS happen every week but also their own personal path of Christian growth and development. Thanks for investing the time to make your leaders better - your contribution is making a difference in their lives and the lives of all the students that they lead.

## Five Behaviors of a Coach  
Please take the time to read through the [Five Behaviors of a Leader](leaders.md#five-behaviors-of-a-leader), as the core concepts are identical. What follows slightly modifies the same behaviors to be representative of the view from the coaching position.  

### Communicate Down  
In the same way and for the same reasons that we expect our leaders to communicate weekly with their students, **coaches should be in communication with their leaders on a weekly basis, outside of seeing them on Wednesday nights**. It may be just a text letting them know that this week's group guide has been posted here, but this will hopefully grow into in-person meetings on a monthly or even quarterly basis. They need to know that you are there and that you care - asking them how you can pray for them this week is a great way to find out more about what is going on in their lives outside of fpStudents.  

### Communicate Up  
Just like you would appreciate a heads up from your leaders when something is going wrong, your senior coach is no different - **let them in on your FPS struggles and victories as well as what's going on with you personally**. Get together with them in person on a regular schedule to keep the communication lines open.  

### Can Do Attitude  
You weren't asked to be a coach in the first place if you had not already proven that you can make things happen. Now you need to take that to the next level and understand that those above you can't have visibility and make decisions about every little situation that comes up in a ministry as big as this. **You are empowered to make any decision that is in the best interest of your leaders and their students** - just be sure to let your senior coach know if something doesn't work out the way you hoped or intended. :)

### Recruit  
It goes without saying that we are constantly in need of more volunteers, but what isn't necessarily obvious is that coaches are on the the front lines in the battle for more people. You know what it takes to be a good leader, and you know what makes a bad one too - use that knowledge to place new recruits in the right spot from the start. Whether you realize it or not, you are truly **being the hands and feet of Jesus by giving them an opportunity to live their best life in service to the Kingdom**. Whether they end up serving in FPS or in some other ministry is in the hands of our Lord - they won't know that opportunity is knocking unless we are the ones to speak up.  

### Add Value  
If you well and truly don't know what to do next, *Add Value* should always be your go-to behavior. How can I make the life of my leaders better today? Maybe it's something simple like praying for them outside their meeting room during small group time or an encouraging message sent to them during the week. No matter what you do, remember that **people are the number one physical asset of fpStudents, and you can never go wrong by adding value to them by loving on your leaders**.
