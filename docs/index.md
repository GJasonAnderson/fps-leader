## Small Group Guides  
- [**Goliath Must Fall Week 1: Dead But Still Deadly**](guide.pdf) - everyone *except 6th grade* should use this guide  
- [**Best Night Week 2: Why We Preach**](guide-6th.pdf) - all new 6th grade groups should use this instead of the above group guide for this week  

## Small Group Service Opportunity
During week 3 of *At The Movies*, Faith Promise will be giving out a t-shirt to everyone in attendance. FP Students will be preparing all of those t-shirts this week. Each small group will find bags, shirts, and stickers in their room on Wednesday night. Your group needs to fold the shirts, place them in bags, and place stickers on the outside. Written instructions will be provided, but it will be very self-explanatory! This will be a be a great chance to serve others, grow together, and gain influence as a ministry. Please direct any questions about this service opportunity to [Noah Marshall](mailto:NoahM@faithpromise.org)!  

## Baptism Night  
If you have a student that wants to be baptized but can't do so on a weekend, counsel them & get parental permission, then [email Taylor Henry](mailto:TaylorH@faithpromise.org) ASAP!  

# The Bash 8/22/2018  
Save this date for our annual back-to-school party - more details to be announced. This is a great event for students to invite guests to!

# Fusion Weekend 2019 | January 18-20  
*Fusion is an overnight weekend retreat that begins on Friday evening and ends on Sunday afternoon. Leaders and students will stay in a local host home for fellowship, small group time, some meals, and trying to get some sleep every night. Live worship services are held Friday night and throughout the day Saturday. The weekend closes out on Sunday at your local campus.*  

Fusion 2019 is earlier in the year that in the past, so it's super important that leaders secure host homes as early as possible. Start asking parents of your students NOW - **our goal this year is for every small group to have a host home by Thanksgiving!**  

# Movement Conference 2019 | July 18-20
*Movement Conference is more than an event, it's a spark to an awakening in the next generation! Movement is a three day local church conference where students from across the state of Tennessee are encouraged and inspired to join the movement and take it back to their schools and communities. More than anything, our desire is to see this generation walk in the power of Jesus and change the world around them for His kingdom.*  

*At Movement Conference, students will experience incredible worship and music, be inspired by world-class communicators, and have a ton of fun with hundreds of other students. An awakening is coming to our nation, and we believe it will start right here in Tennessee! Will you join the Movement?*
