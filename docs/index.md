Here are a few things you need to know for FPS this week:

# Small Group Guide
**[ Fusion Recap Night ]( group-guides/Fusion Recap Night.pdf )**

# Survey Cards This Week
Please grab a survey card from the info desk and make sure these get turned in. When we surveyed earlier this month, we did not get enough back to really count. Our greatest goal is connecting students to the weekend, so please help us measure our results by completing a survey in every group.

# Movement Invite Cards
We would like for every group leader to write a quick card to each student in their group that attended Fusion. In the card, you should:

1. Thank students for coming to Fusion
2. Encourage them personally
3. Invite them personally to attend Movement Conference

Cards will be available at the information desk at 5:45pm on Wednesday, and you can write them at any time during fps. Letâ€™s make the most of this post Fusion opportunity to get our students onboard for Movement!
