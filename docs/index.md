# This Week @ FPS  
Here's what's going on at fpStudents this week, as well as some future events to plan for. Thanks for all that you do to make this ministry a success!

## Wed. Night | 8/8/2018  

### Small Group Guides  
- [**Goliath Must Fall Week 2: Fear**](guide.pdf) - everyone *except 6th grade* should use this guide  
- [**Best Night Week 3: Why We Group**](guide-6th.pdf) - all new 6th grade groups should use this instead of the above group guide for this week  

### Free T-Shirts!
Because of all the hard work last week, we were able to prep almost 7,000 t-shirts for the upcoming [*At the Movies*](https://faithpromise.org/events/atm) giveaway! All students and leaders will get a free t-shirt this week as our way of saying **THANK YOU!**

### Survey Night  
Pick up your survey questions at check-in and turn your results in after small group at the info tables in the lobby. Thanks for helping us measure God's success through this ministry!  

## The Bash | 8/22/2018  
This will be the BIGGEST back to school party in Knoxville! Not only are we going to have fun, but this will be a time where God blesses us with hundreds of new students and VIPs across all campuses. This will be the biggest night of the year at FPS, so we will need all hands on deck. **No small groups this week, plus a minor schedule change** - we will **start at 7:00 PM** with an abbreviated time of worship and a message, followed by a crazy outdoor party that **wraps up at 9:00 PM**.

# Fusion Weekend | 1/18-20/2019  
*Fusion is an overnight weekend retreat that begins on Friday evening and ends on Sunday afternoon. Leaders and students will stay in a local host home for fellowship, small group time, some meals, and trying to get some sleep every night. Live worship services are held Friday night and throughout the day Saturday. The weekend closes out on Sunday at your local campus.*  

Fusion 2019 is earlier in the year that in the past, so it's super important that leaders secure host homes as early as possible. Start asking parents of your students NOW - **our goal this year is for every small group to have a host home by Thanksgiving!**  

# Movement Conference | 7/18-20/2019
*Movement Conference is more than an event, it's a spark to an awakening in the next generation! Movement is a three day local church conference where students from across the state of Tennessee are encouraged and inspired to join the movement and take it back to their schools and communities. More than anything, our desire is to see this generation walk in the power of Jesus and change the world around them for His kingdom.*  

*At Movement Conference, students will experience incredible worship and music, be inspired by world-class communicators, and have a ton of fun with hundreds of other students. An awakening is coming to our nation, and we believe it will start right here in Tennessee! Will you join the Movement?*
