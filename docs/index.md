# This Wednesday 7/11/2018
This week is all about Movement - check the [FPS-Leader.com Movement Conference Page](movement.md) for everything you need to know about it from a Group Leader's perspective.

# Next Wednesday 7/18/2018
FPS will resume it's usual Wednesday night schedule. All small groups will remain in the grade they just completed for this week.

# Next Next Wednesday 7/25/2018
This is the week that we will be leveling all groups up to the grade they will be starting in the fall; more details about that transition will be posted here soon.

<!-- Hold all of this for post-Movement use
### Small Group Guide  
[**_In-N-Out_ Week 5: The Purpose of Your Story**](guide.pdf)

### Student Contacts
Remember that *relationships matter more than anything*. Letâ€™s aim for contacting each student in our groups at least once this week.

### Fall Transition Plan
During the last week of July, all students will be transitioning to their upcoming grade for the fall and  **all small group leaders will rise with their existing group to their new grade**. If you would like to do something different, please let your coach know prior to Movement.
