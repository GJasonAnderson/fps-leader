### Small Group Guide  
**[ Week 3 - I Am Near to God ]( guide.pdf )**  

### Survey Night
Thanks to everyone that completed a survey card last week. Unfortunately, there were not enough responses because we failed to announce the fact that there was a survey. So let's do it again this week - grab a card at leader check-in and turn your numbers into Taylor in the lobby or to your coach.

### Movement Student Registrations
During the month of April, let's all focus on getting our core students registered for Fusion. Direct them to [ the official Movement Conference website ]( https://movementconf.com/ ) to get registered.

### Movement Leader Registration
All leaders should be registered for Movement at this point; if you are attending and haven't registered yet, [ get it done ASAP! ]( movement.md )

### Adults in the Lobby
Recently, we have noticed a surplus of leaders and coaches in the lobby during service. At fps, we want to do everything we can to help engage students during worship and the message. With that being said, we ask that **all adults be in the worship center once service starts**, unless there is an emergency situation or conversation that needs to be had. While we value your relationships with each other and the students, please wait to continue any conversations that are not vital or urgent until after service. Thank you for supporting the vision and culture of fps!
