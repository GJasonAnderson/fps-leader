Here are a few things you need to know for FPS this week:

# Small Group Guide
**[ Closer Week 2: Relationships Both Near and Far ]( group-guides/Closer Week 2.pdf )**

# It's Survey Night
Grab a card at check-in, and turn your results in at the info desk after small group.

# Fusion Registration Deadline - This Wednesday
Because Wednesday at midnight is the deadline for Fusion, we will likely have a huge influx of students wanting to sign up before and after service. Although we will have several iPads available to do this, students will still need assistance in navigating the registration. Coaches and Leaders: if you can be available at the info desk before and/or after service, please let Taylor know so she can walk you through the process beforehand. We will need all hands on deck! 

# Dating Games at FPS
We are really excited to host The Dating Games at fps this week! This is something that weâ€™ve never done before, but we believe it will be a whole lot of fun. We will have the lobby themed for Valentine's Day, a dating panel in service, fun stage and crowd games, and candy grams for each small group. This is going to be great, so lets make every effort to have everyone there.  We will be distributing small groups valentine supplies to each room, so be on the lookout for further directions on Monday!
