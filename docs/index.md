**Movement Conference is only <span id="MyTimer"></span> away now**  

### Small Group Guide  
[**_In-N-Out_ Week 2: You First**](guide.pdf)

### Student Contacts
Group leaders, remember that relationships matter more than anything. The most important thing we can do week in and week out is to pray for our students and contact them to encourage them and check in during the week. Letâ€™s aim for contacting each student in our groups at least once this week.

### More People Like You
We are looking for more heroes like you! If you know of someone at fp who would be a good fit for our team, please invite them to join us.
