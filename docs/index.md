# This Week @ FPS  
Here's what's going on at fpStudents this week, as well as some future events to plan for. Thanks for all that you do to make this ministry a success!

## The Bash | 22 Aug 2018  
This will be the BIGGEST back to school party in Knoxville! Not only are we going to have fun, but this will be a time where God blesses us with hundreds of new students and VIPs across all campuses. This will be the biggest night of the year at FPS, so we will need all hands on deck. **No small groups this week, plus a minor schedule change** - we will **start at 7:00 PM** with an abbreviated time of worship and a message, followed by a crazy outdoor party that **wraps up at 9:00 PM**.

### Baptisms at Last ATM weekend  
If you have any students that need to be baptized, this coming weekend at the last installment of our [*At the Movies*](https://faithpromise.org/events/atm) is a great time to get it done. Please invite ALL your students and families to attend!

## Fusion Weekend | 18-20 Jan 2019  
*Fusion is an overnight weekend retreat that begins on Friday evening and ends on Sunday afternoon. Leaders and students will stay in a local host home for fellowship, small group time, meals, and some sleep each night. Music, worship, speaker messages, and just-for-fun events are experienced Friday night and throughout the day Saturday. The weekend closes out on Sunday at your local Faith Promise campus.*  

Fusion 2019 is earlier in the year that in the past, so it's super important that leaders secure host homes as early as possible. Start asking the parents of your students NOW - **our goal this year is for every small group to have a host home by Thanksgiving!**  

## Movement Conference | 18-20 July 2019
*Movement is a three day conference where students from across the state of Tennessee are encouraged and inspired to join the movement and take it back to their schools and communities. Students will experience incredible worship and music, be inspired by world-class communicators, and have a ton of fun with hundreds of other students. An awakening is coming to our nation, and we believe it will start right here, right now - will you join the Movement?*
