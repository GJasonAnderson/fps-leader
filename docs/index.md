# This Week @ FPS  
Here's what's going on at fpStudents this week, as well as some future events to plan for. Thanks for all that you do to make this ministry a success!  

<a class="btn btn-primary btn-block" href="#30-nov-2018-fusion-host-home-registration-deadline" role="button">Only <b><span id="MyTimer"></span></b> until the Fusion 2019 Host Home Registration Deadline!</a>

## 14 Nov 2018 | Baptism Night  
We always encourage baptisms during weekend services to allow full family participation. However, if you have any students that can't get it done on the weekend for some reason, this will be their last chance in 2018 to be baptized on Wednesday night. Email <a href="mailto:TaylorH@faithpromise.org">Taylor Henry</a> if you have any students in this situation. <s>Our Heart for the Harvest offering will also happen tonight.</s> *Sorry for the mistake, we won't be taking up a separate FPS-specific H4H this week.*

## 30 Nov 2018 | Fusion Host Home Registration Deadline  
Fusion 2019 is earlier in the year than in the past, so it's super important that leaders secure host homes as early as possible. Let us know where your group is staying at the [Fusion 2019 Host Home Registration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXV04WAgmCv1IVQsg0SbhXDg8JXIhdhzvgeh-BPC3PSPSrBQ/viewform?c=0&w=1&usp=mail_form_link) page.

# 18-20 Jan 2019 | Fusion Weekend   
*Fusion is an overnight weekend retreat that begins on Friday evening and ends on Sunday afternoon. Leaders and students will stay in a local host home for fellowship, small group time, meals, and some sleep each night. Music, worship, speaker messages, and just-for-fun events are experienced Friday night and throughout the day Saturday. The weekend closes out on Sunday at your local Faith Promise campus.*  

## Student Registration

# 17-21 July 2019 | Movement Conference  
*Movement is a three day conference where students from across the state of Tennessee are encouraged and inspired to join the movement and take it back to their schools and communities. Students will experience incredible worship and music, be inspired by world-class communicators, and have a ton of fun with hundreds of other students. An awakening is coming to our nation, and we believe it will start right here, right now - will you join the Movement?*
