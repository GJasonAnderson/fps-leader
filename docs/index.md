## 31 Oct 2018 | Costume Night  
All groups will find a piñata in your room this week - have fun beating the candy out of it! Also, wear a costume this week for **triple Squad Wars points** and post a pick of your group in costume to **social media using #SquadWars for last minute bonus points** - this could be your squad's chance to pull off a comeback and win it all!

### Squad Wars FAQ  
**What is Squad Wars?**  
Squad Wars is our yearly momentum building month.  We do Squad Wars to arm students and leaders with a tool to use in inviting others to fps.  This plays out as a competition between squads (grades) that includes a theme they can participate in, stage games, social media challenges, etc. The squads are competing for a large prize for the entire squad. While it is always extra work to pull off, every time we have done it God has brought a supernatural momentum to the ministry and with that at stake we cannot pass up this incredible opportunity!  

**Do I need to participate?**  
Yes! While it is certainly out of a lot of our comfort zones, time and time again we see that where the most bought in leaders are so also are the most bought in students.  When you participate so will your students!  

**What are the themes?**  

| Date          | Theme                                               |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| <s>3 Oct</s>  | <s>Blackout</s>                                     |
| <s>10 Oct</s> | <s>PJ Night</s>                                     |
| <s>17 Oct</s> | <s>Color Wars</s>                                   |
| <s>24 Oct</s> | <s>Social Media Challenge @ Live Original Tour</s>  |
| **31 Oct**    | [**Costume Night**](#31-oct-2018-costume-night)     |

**How do we win points?**  
VIPs – 800 points. Bringing first time guests is the BEST way to win points.   
Stage Games – 1,200 points.  This is a chunk of points, but again: the BEST way to win points is bringing VIPs.  
Social Media Challenges – 200 points for participation, 1,000 points for winner.  
Theme Participation – 100 points per student who participates.  

**How are points calculated?**
Each week we will be sending out a squad wars update.  This will include all of the ways to win points for the upcoming week.  **Coaches will be responsible for collecting the data for each of those things from your leaders and sending to <a href="mailto:noahm@faithpromise.org">NoahM@faithpromise.org</a> at the end of each Wednesday night.**  Our team will do the work of compiling points and a point update will go out early each week on Instagram. To ensure your squad gets the points it has earned, please make this a priority.  

**What squad am I on?**  

| Grade | Squad  |
|-------|--------|
| 6th   | Red    |
| 7th   | Teal   |
| 8th   | Blue   |
| 9th   | White  |
| 10th  | Yellow |
| 11th  | Orange |
| 12th  | Black  |

**What will my squad get if we win?**  
The final prize that all of the squads will be competing for is food in small group EVERY WEEK in December!  We will be putting together a package of food options each group will be able to individually decide upon including Chick-Fil-A, Dessert, Pizza, Wings, etc. Lets use this to motivate students (and leaders, lets be honest) to own this month!

## 7 Nov 2018 | Decision Night  
Pastor Jeff will be encouraging decisions about salvation and baptism - be ready to counsel students in the lobby, as well as call parents and schedule baptisms, *especially if anyone from your group steps up*.

## 14 Nov 2018 | Baptism Night & H4H  
We always encourage baptisms during weekend services to allow full family participation. However, if you have any students that can't get it done on the weekend for some reason, this will be their last chance in 2018 to be baptized on Wednesday night. Email <a href="mailto:TaylorH@faithpromise.org">Taylor Henry</a> if you have any students in this situation. Our Heart for the Harvest offering will also happen tonight.    

## 30 Nov 2018 | Fusion Host Home Registration Deadline  
Fusion 2019 is earlier in the year than in the past, so it's super important that leaders secure host homes as early as possible. Let us know where your group is staying at the [Fusion 2019 Host Home Registration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXV04WAgmCv1IVQsg0SbhXDg8JXIhdhzvgeh-BPC3PSPSrBQ/viewform?c=0&w=1&usp=mail_form_link) page.

# 18-20 Jan 2019 | Fusion Weekend   
*Fusion is an overnight weekend retreat that begins on Friday evening and ends on Sunday afternoon. Leaders and students will stay in a local host home for fellowship, small group time, meals, and some sleep each night. Music, worship, speaker messages, and just-for-fun events are experienced Friday night and throughout the day Saturday. The weekend closes out on Sunday at your local Faith Promise campus.*

# 17-21 July 2019 | Movement Conference
