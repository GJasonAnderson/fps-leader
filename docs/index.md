### Student Contacts
Remember that *relationships matter more than anything*. Letâ€™s aim for contacting each student in our groups at least once this week.

### Fall Transition Plan
During the last week of July, all students will be transitioning to their upcoming grade for the fall and  **all small group leaders will rise with their existing group to their new grade**. If you would like to do something different, please let your coach know prior to Movement.
