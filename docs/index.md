### Small Group Guide  
[**_Just One More_ Week : Don't Compromise your Purity**](guide.pdf)

### Student Name Tag Check
Please check your student's name tags on a regular basis and make sure the correct group / leader info is on it. Please [email Taylor Henry](mailto:TaylorH@faithpromise.org) any corrrections that need to be made. This is a basic safety issue - we need to be able to quickly find students in the event of an emergency.
