# This Wednesday 8/1/2018
School starts in Knox Co. one week from this Wednesday - let's help get our students prepared to take every opportunity to live out their faith this school year. Pastor Jeff wants FPS Pellissippi to grow to over 700 in attendance by the end of the school year - I'm believing God will make it happen before Christmas break if we send our students back to school fully prepared to share the hope of Jesus with their classmates!

## Small Group Guides
- [**My Movement Week 3: Connecting with Each Other**](guide.pdf) - everyone *except 6th grade* should use this guide  
- [**6th Grade Guide: Best Night of the Week**](guide-6th.pdf) - all new 6th grade groups should use this instead of the above group guide for this week  

# FPS Grow Conference 8/4/2018

# Next Wednesday 8/8/2018 - FPS Baptism Night!
This is when we baptize students that cannot do so at a weekend FP service. If you have a student that wants to be baptized next Wednesday and you have counseled them & have parental permission, [email Taylor Henry](mailto:taylorh@faithpromise.org) so we can help them take this public step of obedience to God and his Word!  

# The Bash 8/22/2018
