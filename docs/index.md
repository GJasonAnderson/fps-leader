# This Week @ FPS

## 6 Feb 2019 | *More Than Friends* Week 1 & Series Explanation  
As we enter February, we are beginning a 3-week relationships series is called *More than Friends*. This will be a very sensitive topic for some students and parents, so **we are asking that all leaders communicate with the parents of their students; especially middle school**. Week 3 will be a Parent connection night, and we will have a card/certificate for each student to sign. We do not want parents to be caught off guard, so they are also welcome to attend all 3 weeks. Our central team will be sending out emails to all fpStudents households explaining the topics covered in the series, as well as a week 3 invite. Please be sure to explain the nature of this series to leaders and emphasize the importance of partnering with parents. See email message below that was sent out to all parents:  

>Hey Parents!

>Love is in the air and we wanted to let you know that we’re on your team — we are partnering with you this February in fps by discussing topics like dating and sex in our next series “More Than Friends”. Over the next 3 weeks we’ll cover obsession, breakups, and God’s design for sex with a special online message on what purity really is.

>On February 20th we want to invite you to a special Wednesday night as we offer students an opportunity to commit to trust God’s plan and design for sex. This is a great opportunity to connect with your student and gain some helpful conversation starters.

>Stay in touch with your student's group leader and feel free to ask any questions or let us know of any concerns.

>We love you!  

>Zac Stephens
