### Small Group Guide  
**[ Week 4 - I Am a Child of God ]( guide.pdf )**  

### Movement Student Registrations
During the month of April, let's all focus on getting our core students registered for Fusion. Direct them to [the official Movement Conference website](https://movementconf.com/) to get registered. For each grade and gender, we have both student and adult Movement Champions who will be visiting groups each week to talk about Movement Conference. Please encourage and support them when they stop by your group!

### Adults in the Lobby
We want to do everything we can to help engage students during worship and the message, so **all adults should be in the worship center once service starts**. Thank you for supporting the vision and culture of fps!

# SKO 5/30/2018
Mark your calendars - Summer Kick Off this year will be all night trip to [Wilderness at the Smokies](https://www.wildernessatthesmokies.com/)! Registrations will open later this week; cost will be $40 per student. **If you can help serve during SKO**, please let your coach know!
