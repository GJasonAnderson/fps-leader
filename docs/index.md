# This Wednesday 4/4/2018

### Small Group Guide  
*New series starts this week:* **[ I AM Week 1 - Alive in Christ ]( guide.pdf )**  

### Movement Leader Registration
Please complete your FREE leader registration for Movement on this site's [ Movement Page ]( movement.md ) by the end of this week!

### Student Contacts
Remember that **relationships matter more than anything**. Perhaps the most important thing we can do week in and week out is to pray for our students and contact them to encourage them and check in during the week. Letâ€™s aim for contacting each student in our groups at least once this week.

### The Dream Team
What we need most at fps is more leaders like you! If you know someone who would be great at fps, let them know the potential you see in them and invite them to join us on any Wednesday in April.

# Next Wednesday 4/11/2018
*More info about next week will be posted here as it becomes available.*
