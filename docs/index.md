## Small Group Guides  
- [**Goliath Must Fall Week 1: Dead But Still Deadly**](guide.pdf) - everyone *except 6th grade* should use this guide  
- [**Best Night Week 2: Why We Preach**](guide-6th.pdf) - all new 6th grade groups should use this instead of the above group guide for this week  

## Small Group Service Opportunity
During week 3 of *At The Movies*, Faith Promise will be giving out a t-shirt to everyone in attendance. FP Students will be preparing all of those t-shirts this week. Each small group will find bags, shirts, and stickers in their room on Wednesday night. Your group needs to fold the shirts, place them in bags, and place stickers on the outside. Written instructions will be provided, but it will be very self-explanatory! This will be a be a great chance to serve others, grow together, and gain influence as a ministry. Please direct any questions about this service opportunity to [Noah Marshall](mailto:NoahM@faithpromise.org)!  

## Baptism Night  
If you have a student that wants to be baptized but can't do so on a weekend, counsel them & get parental permission, then [email Taylor Henry](mailto:TaylorH@faithpromise.org) ASAP!  

# The Bash 8/22/2018
