## Top 10 Things Every Fusion Leader Should Know

1. **Friday night Pastor Zac will be speaking an giving an invitation for salvation.** We will need **ALL Leaders** to head back to the lobby hallway when Zac calls for us. **Staff will be waiting on you with counseling books** that will guide you through leading students to the Lord. **Please be ready** for this so that we can love on students well in the moment.
2. **Many students will decide to take the step of Baptism** this weekend. Leaders, please talk to your students about this, especially with those who will give their life to Christ during Fusion. Please make sure they understand what baptism is for and **make sure we have parent permission** to baptize them this weekend during Sunday service. Once you have this and a student is ready, <font color=red>**please email their name to**</font> [ TaylorH@faithpromise.org ]( mailto:TaylorH@faithpromise.org ).
3. Every student **MUST have a seatbelt** when being transported.
4. **We want to love on our host home providers** and thank them well. Please talk to students about honoring these incredible people. Also, please have your group **leave a thank you card** at the end of the weekend. **Faith Promise cards will be available** at the info desk Friday and Saturday.
5. When students arrive at the host home tomorrow, **please have parents sign them in on the sign in sheet. <font color=red>Do not leave until all students on your list are accounted for.**</font>
6. **Parents will turn their Time Out cards in to you at drop off** if their child needs to leave at any point during the weekend. Leaders, please keep these and make sure to **check the ID of the person who picks them up** and make sure it matches the name on the time out card.
7. **Parents will also drop off medications** for the students with you. Please make sure these get administered and are **stored in a safe place** where students cannot get to them.
8. We will have a **Leader Lounge with snacks and drinks** just for you in the fishbowl all weekend. Please stop by and catch your breath from time to time and know <font color=red>**we love you!**</font>
9. **Some host homes will have staff visitors on Friday and Saturday night.** We will try not to stay too long, but will show up at as many host homes as we can to love on the kids.
10. **Pastor Chris is preaching Saturday night, so be prepared for anything.** We don’t know what the Lord will lay on his heart, but let’s be ready to answer the call!
