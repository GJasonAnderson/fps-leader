Here are a few things you need to know for FPS this week:

# Small Group Guide
**[ Realest Week 4: The Weekend ]( group-guides/Realest Week 4.pdf )**

# Leader Seating in Large Group
As a reminder, please make an effort to be in the worship center during the service. Also, we want to make it a priority to sit within the student congregation, so please do not sit beside or behind the sound booth, *even if the curtains are open*. Let's set good examples both in worship and during the message by taking notes, not texting, etc.
