### Small Group Guide  
**[ Week 2 - I Am Forgiven ]( guide.pdf )**  

### Large Group - Movement Q&A with Pastor Zac
Pastor Zac will be holding an open question and answer session about Movement from stage during Large Group on Wednesday. We would love for all of our FPS adults to be there: small group leaders, coaches, crew, you name it! We are also inviting the parents of our fpStudents to attend and get there questions answered, receive a little clarity, and hear our heart and vision for the conference. Bring your questions and let’s all join together as FPS adults to lead the charge for Movement this year!

### Movement Student Registrations
During the month of April, let's all focus on getting our core students registered for Fusion. Direct them to [ the official Movement Conference website ]( https://movementconf.com/ ) to get registered.

### Movement Leader Registration
All leaders should be registered for Movement at this point; if you are attending and haven't registered yet, [ get it done ASAP! ]( movement.md )

# Next Wednesday 4/18/2018

### Student Contacts
Remember that **relationships matter more than anything**. Perhaps the most important thing we can do week in and week out is to pray for our students and contact them to encourage them and check in during the week. Let’s aim for contacting each student in our groups at least once this week.

### The Dream Team
What we need most at fps is more leaders like you! If you know someone who would be great at fps, let them know the potential you see in them and invite them to join us on any Wednesday in April.
