# This Wednesday 8/15/2018  

## Small Group Guides  
- [**Goliath Must Fall Week 2: Fear**](guide.pdf) - everyone *except 6th grade* should use this guide  
- [**Best Night Week 3: Why We Group**](guide-6th.pdf) - all new 6th grade groups should use this instead of the above group guide for this week  

## Free T-Shirts!
Because of all the hard work last week, we were able to prep almost 7,000 t-shirts for the upcoming [*At the Movies*](https://faithpromise.org/events/atm) giveaway! All students and leaders will get a free t-shirt this week as our way of saying **THANK YOU!**

## Survey Night  
Pick up your survey questions at check-in and turn your results in after small group at the info tables in the lobby. Thanks for helping us measure God's success through this ministry!  

# The Bash 8/22/2018  
This will be the BIGGEST back to school party in Knoxville! Not only are we going to have fun, but this will be a time where God blesses us with hundreds of new students and VIPâ€™s across all campuses. This will be the biggest night of the year at FPS, so we will need all hands on deck. **No small groups this week, plus a minor schedule change** - we will **start at 7:00 PM** with an abbreviated time of worship and a message, followed by a crazy outdoor party that **wraps up at 9:00 PM**.
