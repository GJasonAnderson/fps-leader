# This Week @ FPS  
Here's what's going on at fpStudents this week, as well as some future events to plan for. Thanks for all that you do to make this ministry a success!  

<!-- HIDE HOST HOME STUFF UNTIL CERTAIN WE'RE ALL DONE

<a class="btn btn-danger btn-block" href="#30-nov-2018-fusion-host-home-registration-deadline" role="button">Only <b><span id="MyTimer"></span></b> until the Fusion 2019 Host Home Registration Deadline!</a>

## 30 Nov 2018 | Fusion Host Home Registration Deadline  
Fusion 2019 is earlier in the year than in the past, so it's super important that leaders secure host homes as early as possible. Let us know where your group is staying at the [Fusion 2019 Host Home Registration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXV04WAgmCv1IVQsg0SbhXDg8JXIhdhzvgeh-BPC3PSPSrBQ/viewform?c=0&w=1&usp=mail_form_link) page.

## 8 Dec 2018 | *All is Bright* Service Opportunity  
[All is Bright](https://faithpromise.org/events/all-is-bright) is a great opportunity for your small group to serve the community this Christmas.

FYI, this is the event at the [Boys & Girls Club on Irwin Street](https://goo.gl/maps/g4QEnm3nUNr) - it is NOT at the Pellissippi campus.

## 10 Dec 2018 | *Christmas Spectacular* Service Opportunity  
The FPS team will be helping get ready for this year's [Christmas Spectacular](https://www.fpchristmas.com/) from 5PM-9PM. If you can join us at this time or wish to serve some other way, maybe decorating cookies in Mrs. Claus' Kitchen or just hanging out in the Snow Lounge, [let us know what you can do to help](https://faithpromise.typeform.com/to/rb0Doe).  

## 12 Dec 2018 | *Christmas Spectacular* Begins  
This Wednesday will be the first [Christmas Spectacular](https://www.fpchristmas.com/) service at Pellissippi, with the fun starting at 6:15 PM and a service at 7:00 PM. Bring the whole family along for a great time at church!  

## 19 Dec 2018 | Last FPS Before Christmas  
We will be having both an Ugly Sweater Party and the World's Largest Indoor Snowball Fight - you don't want to miss this!
