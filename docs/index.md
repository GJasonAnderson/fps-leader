# This Week @ FPS  
Here's what's going on at fpStudents this week, as well as some future events to plan for. Thanks for all that you do to make this ministry a success!  

<a class="btn btn-primary btn-block" href="#11-nov-2018-fusion-host-home-registration-deadline" role="button">Only <b><span id="MyTimer"></span></b> until the Fusion 2019 Host Home Registration Deadline!</a>


## 10 Oct 2018 | PJ Night  
Wear your pajamas and get comfortable with us at FPS this week. It's Knox Co. Schools fall break, so don't worry if attendance seems a little less than usual. Also, please remember to have the lobby clear and be in large group by 7:05 PM - that goes for students and leaders!    

### Group Guide  
This week we are beginning a new series called *Asking for a Friend*, in which we will discus anxiety, depression, loneliness, abandonment, unforgiveness, addictions, and sin. Due to the heavy nature of this series, we are also providing Crisis Conversation Guides for both high school and middle school to go along with the weekly Group Guides.

### Reserve Your *Live Original Tour* Tickets  
This week is your last chance to reserve free tickets for [Sadie Robertson's Live Original Tour](https://liveoriginal.com/). **You must reserve a seat in order to attend fpStudents on 24 Oct 2018.**  

### New *Weekly Update* Email and the Future of This Website  
Starting this week, FPS is now sending out a *Weekly Update* email every Wednesday night that contains the group guide for next week and any related announcements. This email goes out to all leaders directly and makes this website redundant and possibly unnecessary. **Please take a few seconds to tell us how this will affect your future usage of this website.**

<form name="Future_Form" netlify>
	I believe that FPS-Leader.com is...<br>
  <input type="radio" name="future" value="keep_the_site_going"> really useful for me, and I prefer it to an email - please keep the site going.<br>
  <input type="radio" name="future" value="shut_the_site_down"> not needed by me anymore because of the new email system - if it shuts down, I won't miss it.<br>

### Squad Wars FAQ  
**What is Squad Wars?**  
Squad Wars is our yearly momentum building month.  We do Squad Wars to arm students and leaders with a tool to use in inviting others to fps.  This plays out as a competition between squads (grades) that includes a theme they can participate in, stage games, social media challenges, etc. The squads are competing for a large prize for the entire squad. While it is always extra work to pull off, every time we have done it God has brought a supernatural momentum to the ministry and with that at stake we cannot pass up this incredible opportunity!  

**Do I need to participate?**  
Yes! While it is certainly out of a lot of our comfort zones, time and time again we see that where the most bought in leaders are so also are the most bought in students.  When you participate so will your students!  

**What are the themes?**  

| Date          | Theme                                                                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **10 Oct**    | [**PJ Night**](#10-oct-2018-pj-night)                                                 |
| 17 Oct        | [Color Wars](#17-oct-2018-color-wars)                                                 |

**How do we win points?**  
VIPs – 800 points. Bringing first time guests is the BEST way to win points.   
Stage Games – 1,200 points.  This is a chunk of points, but again: the BEST way to win points is bringing VIPs.  
Social Media Challenges – 200 points for participation, 1,000 points for winner.  
Theme Participation – 100 points per student who participates.  

**How are points calculated?**
Each week we will be sending out a squad wars update.  This will include all of the ways to win points for the upcoming week.  **Coaches will be responsible for collecting the data for each of those things from your leaders and sending to Noah (NoahM@faithpromise.org) at the end of each Wednesday night.**  Our team will do the work of compiling points and a point update will go out early each week on Instagram. To ensure your squad gets the points it has earned, please make this a priority.  

**What squad am I on?**  

| Grade | Squad  |
|-------|--------|
| 6th   | Red    |
| 7th   | Teal   |
| 8th   | Blue   |
| 9th   | White  |
| 10th  | Yellow |
| 11th  | Orange |
| 12th  | Black  |

**What will my squad get if we win?**  
The final prize that all of the squads will be competing for is food in small group EVERY WEEK in December!  We will be putting together a package of food options each group will be able to individually decide upon including Chick-Fil-A, Dessert, Pizza, Wings, etc. Lets use this to motivate students (and leaders, lets be honest) to own this month!  

## 17 Oct 2018 | Color Wars

# 18-20 Jan 2019 | Fusion Weekend
